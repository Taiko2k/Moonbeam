## Moonbeam VRC
A VRChat companion app for Linux. 
</div>

Intended to be an alternative to [VRCX](https://github.com/vrcx-team/VRCX), but maybe narrower in scope.

Implemented features:

 - See which of your friends are online
 - View friend bio information
 - Location tracker
 - Youtube URL extraction

⚠️ Warnings:

 1. This app is early in development, it may be buggy or even not work at all.
 2. This app tries to be nice to the VRChat API, but there's no guarantee.
 3. Account switching is not currently supported. Behavior when logging in with various different accounts is undefined.
