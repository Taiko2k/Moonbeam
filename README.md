## Moonbeam VRC
A VRChat companion app for Linux.

Intended to be an alternative to [VRCX](https://github.com/vrcx-team/VRCX), but maybe narrower in scope.

Current features:

 - See which of your friends are online
 - View friend information
 - Location tracker
 - Youtube URL extraction

⚠️ This app is currently alpha quality and not ready for general use. Leave a star and come back later!
